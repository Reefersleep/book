== Child processes

There are several ways of creating child processes in babashka. All of them are
implemented using the `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` and `java.lang.Process`
classes. The easiest way to create a process is via `clojure.java.shell`:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (require '[clojure.java.shell :refer [sh]])
nil
user=> (sh "ls")
{:exit 0, :out "README.md\ndist\ngh-pages\nscript\nsrc\n", :err ""}
----

As you can see the result of `:out` are the lines of text produced by `ls`. The
`:exit` code was `0` and there was no output on stderr.

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (sh "ls" "foo")
{:exit 1, :out "", :err "ls: foo: No such file or directory\n"}
----

If we invoke `ls` with a non-existing file, there is error output, but not
output on stdout and the `:exit` code is `1`.

For more information on `clojure.java.shell`, read the https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.java.shell-api.html[API documentation].
