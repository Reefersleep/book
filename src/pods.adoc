== Pods

Pods are programs that can be used as a Clojure library by
babashka. Documentation is available in the
https://github.com/babashka/babashka.pods[library repo].

A list of available pods can be found
https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/blob/master/doc/projects.md#pods[here].

=== Pod registry

Since bb 0.2.6 pods can be obtained via the https://github.com/babashka/pod-registry[pod-registry].

This is an example script which uses
https://github.com/retrogradeorbit/bootleg[bootleg] as a pod to convert hiccup
to HTML.
