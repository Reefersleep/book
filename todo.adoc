== Differences with Clojure

Babashka is implemented using the https://github.com/borkdude/sci[Small
Clojure Interpreter]. This means that a snippet or script is not
compiled to JVM bytecode, but executed form by form by a runtime which
implements a substantial subset of Clojure. Babashka is compiled to a
native binary using https://github.com/oracle/graal[GraalVM]. It comes
with a selection of built-in namespaces and functions from Clojure and
other useful libraries. The data types (numbers, strings, persistent
collections) are the same. Multi-threading is supported (`pmap`,
`future`).

Differences with Clojure:

* A pre-selected set of Java classes are supported. You cannot add Java
classes at runtime.
* Interpretation comes with overhead. Therefore loops are slower than in
Clojure on the JVM. In general interpretation yields slower programs
than compiled programs.
* No `deftype`, `definterface` and unboxed math.
* `defprotocol` and `defrecord` are implemented using multimethods and
regular maps. Ostensibly they work the same, but under the hood there
are no Java classes that correspond to them.
* Currently `reify` works only for one class at a time
* The `clojure.core.async/go` macro is not (yet) supported. For
compatibility it currently maps to `clojure.core.async/thread`. More
info link:#coreasync[here].

== link:doc/projects.md[Libraries, pods and projects]

A list of projects (scripts, libraries, pods and tools) known to work
with babashka.

== Pods

Pods are programs that can be used as a Clojure library by babashka.
Documentation is available in the
https://github.com/babashka/babashka.pods[library repo].

== Package babashka script as a AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda runtime doesn't support signals, therefore babashka has to
disable handling of SIGINT and SIGPIPE. This can be done by setting
`BABASHKA_DISABLE_SIGNAL_HANDLERS` to `true`.

== Including new libraries or classes

Before new libraries or classes go into the standardly distributed
babashka binary, these evaluation criteria are considered:

* The library or class is useful for general purpose scripting.
* Adding the library or class would make babashka more compatible with
Clojure libraries relevant to scripting.
* The library cannot be interpreted by with babashka using
`--classpath`.
* The functionality can't be met by shelling out to another CLI or can't
be written as a small layer over an existing CLI (like `babashka.curl`)
instead.
* The library cannot be implemented a
https://github.com/babashka/babashka.pods[pod].

If not all of the criteria are met, but adding a feature is still useful
to a particular company or niche, adding it behind a feature flag is
still a possibility. This is currently the case for `next.jdbc` and the
`PostgresQL` and `HSQLDB` database drivers. Companies interested in
these features can compile an instance of babashka for their internal
use. Companies are also free to make forks of babashka and include their
own internal libraries. If their customized babashka is interesting to
share with the world, they are free to distribute it using a different
binary name (like `bb-sql`, `bb-docker`, `bb-yourcompany`, etc.). See
the link:doc/build.md#feature-flags[feature flag documentation] and the
implementation of the existing feature flags
(https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/commit/02c7c51ad4b2b1ab9aa95c26a74448b138fe6659[example
commit]).
