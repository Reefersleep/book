# Contributing to Babashka book

## Licensing

TL;DR:

- The content of this book is free for use but not intended to be modified
or sold commercially.
- If the day might come that a publisher wants to sell printed or digital
  versions of the babashka book, I want to be able to include your contributions
  without strings attached. Therefore I can only accept contributions that are
  licensed appropriately.

Longer version:

The full book itself is licensed under a [Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)
license, meaning that it can be freely distributed but not modified or resold
commercially. This is to prevent third parties from profiting commercially by
redistributing something intended to be free. Technically speaking, this book is
open source in the "free as in beer" sense, rather than "free as in speech."

However, in order for me to accept submissions, those submissions must be
licensed such that I can in fact use your submission to create derivative works,
sell print copies, and distribute it under a more restrictive license.

Therefore, all sizable public contributions (anything more than a typo
correction) must be licensed under the license found
[here](.license-assignments/template.md). The easiest way to do this is by
placing a copy of
[.license-assignments/template.md](.license-assignments/template.md) in the
[.license-assignments/](.license-assignments) folder with the name `<your github
username>.md` the very first time you make a contribution.

Source files should contain comments indicating the name of the author for which
you want to receive attribution.
